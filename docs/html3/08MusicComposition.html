<h2><a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman" name="2Brozman">Polyrhythm and Musical Culture - Brozman</a></h2>

<dd>
In his article, Bob Brozman suggests a variety of rhythmic exercises for the reader to perform to get a feel for polyrhythm. 
While we have tried to describe these exercises in as clear language as possible they can be confusing especially for non-musicians. 
My colleague, Daniel Steinberg, generously donated a long evening to interpret and perform these excercises.

<p>
The following are MPEG1 encoded video clips of each exercise:

<ul>
<li> Example 1: <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex1.mpg"><b>1</b>,2,3,<b>1</b>,2,3 with 1's accented</a> (accent is external stimulus, and the 1,2,3 grouping the internal stimulus)

<li> Example 2: <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex2.mpg">Comparing external stimuli by accenting the 1 in <b>1</b>,2,<b>1</b>,2 or <b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4</a>

<li> Example 3: <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex3.mpg">Different ways to count 12 cycle: <b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4 vs <b>1</b>,2,3,<b>2</b>,2,3,<b>3</b>,2,3,<b>4</b>,2,3 vs 1 and-a, 2 and-a, 3 and-a, 4 and-a</a>

<li> Example 4: Tension can be created by <i>playing</i> the external stimuli by moving the accented beats. One musician might accent the 1's: <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex4.mpg">
<b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4</a>

<li> Example 5: Superimposing cycles of 12. 4 sets of three pulses and 3 sets of four pulses:
<a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex5.mpg">
<br>
<b>1</b>,2,3,<b>1</b>,2,3,<b>1</b>,2,3,<b>1</b>,2,3 on 
<br>
<b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4</a>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Example 6: First use of <i>and</i> is to divide every beat in 1/2 <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex6.mpg">1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and</a>

<li> Example 7: Second use of <i>and</i> divides beat into three parts (triplets) by saying the <b>AND</b> as <b>and a</b><a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex7.mpg">
1 and a 2 and a 3 and a 4 and a</a>

<li> Example 8: Third use of <i>and</i>, the blues shuffle, also divides beat into triplets, the <i>2</i> of each triplet (the <i>and</i> of each <i>and a</i>) is silent leaving: <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex8.mpg">
1 - a 2 - a 3 - a 4 - a</a>

<li> Example 9: 
A final rare use of <i>and</i> and may sound unusual to the uninitiated listener. The <b>3</b> of each triplet is silent, the beat is divided into thirds, and has a forcefully sounded <b>AND</b>
<a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex9.mpg"> 1 and - 2 and - 3 and - 4 and -</a>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Example 10: First triplet exercise <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex10.mpg">
triplets with alternating hands </a>

<li> Example 11: Second triplet exercise <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex11.mpg">
tiplets alternating beats between leg and chest</a>

<li> Example 12: Strengthen internal resolve by <i>playing</i> one of the beats silently <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex12.mpg">alternating triplets with silent beat</a>

<li> Example 13: Finaly further strengthen both internal count and external stimulus by
<a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex13.mpg">alternating triplet on hand and foot</a>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Example 14: Basic Polyrhythm playing 2 against 3 with both hands <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex14.mpg">
<br> <b>1</b> 2 <b> 3 </b> 4 <b>5</b> 6 (right hand)
<br> <b>1</b> 2 3 <b>4</b> 5 6 (left hand)
</a>

<li> Example 15: Increasing differentiation and coordination by <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex15.mpg">
walking in three clapping in two</a>

<li> Example 16: The <i>other way</i><a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex16.mpg">
walking in two clapping in three</a>

<li> Example 17: If you can perform 
<a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex17.mpg">
polyrhythm while holding a conversation 
</a> then you have integrated the skills 

<li> Example 18: More challenging polyrhythm<a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex18.mpg">three against four on hands</a>

<li> Example 19: <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex19.mpg">three against four on hands and chest</a>

<li> Example 20: <i>Expansion</i> of 3/4 waltz meter to 
<a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex20.mpg">
6/8 time</a>
opens the door to 2-against-3 syncopation possibilities

The following example demonstrates the effects of two sine waves that are out of sync.

<dd>
<a href="../html/do.cgi?Content3+07Synchronization+1Greenebaum-Intro&phasing&0%209.1%205%201">phasing 0 9.1 5 1</a> generates two 440 Hz sine waves.  The sine waves gradually shift in and out of sync over the first 5 seconds, which results in audible attenuation of the signal.

<dd>
These examples demonstrate the various techniques for starting playback of an audio signal.
</dd>
<p>
<dd>
  <a href="../html/do.cgi?Content3+07Synchronization+3Greenebaum-Sync_Pipelines&chirp1">chirp1</a> plays a short &quot;click&quot; once a second.  In between each click, the program is told to <tt>sleep()</tt> for one second.
</dd>
<dd>
  <a href="../html/do.cgi?Content3+07Synchronization+3Greenebaum-Sync_Pipelines&chirp2">chirp2</a> does something similar, but instead of using <tt>sleep()</tt>, which is subject to all sort of inaccuracies, silence is played for the remaining time until the next cycle.  For example, if our sampling rate is 44.1 kHz, and the chirp is 100 samples long, then 44000 of silence is played.
</dd>
<dd>
  <a href="../html/do.cgi?Content3+07Synchronization+3Greenebaum-Sync_Pipelines&trigger">trigger</a> is a simple program that reports a time when an impulse is detected on the sound input device.  So, if you connect your computer's line out to its line in (or place your computer's microphone close to the loudspeaker) and then start trigger together with chirp1 or chirp2, it will report the intervals between clicks.  For chirp1, it will be noticeably inaccurate, whereas for chirp2, it will be accurate to the nearest sample (within 23 microseconds).

<h2><a href="../../Content3/07Synchronization/4Lee-DriftSync" name="4Lee">Dynamic Synchronization: Drifting into Sync - Lee</a></h2>

<dd>
Here, we demonstrate the effects on synchronization of various values of the parameter <i>a</i> discussed in Section 5 of the article.  For illustration purposes, we use two sine waves, at 440 Hz.  While they start off in sync, one is playing at a rate of 1.1x relative to the other one, resulting in a clearly audible drift.
</dd>
<p>
<dd>
  <a href="../html/do.cgi?Content3+07Synchronization+4Lee-DriftSync&sync&1.1%200.495">sync 1.1 0.495</a> - The system is unstable, resulting in a drift that increases with time.
</dd>
<dd>
  <a href="../html/do.cgi?Content3+07Synchronization+4Lee-DriftSync&sync&1.1%200.5">sync 1.1 0.50</a> - The system is marginally stable (the drift doesn't get any better or worse with time).  However, there are serious warbling artifacts in the audio.
</dd>
<dd>
  <a href="../html/do.cgi?Content3+07Synchronization+4Lee-DriftSync&sync&1.1%200.505">sync 1.1 0.505</a> - The system is asymptotically stable; the warbling is still audible, but will eventually go away.
</dd>
<dd>
  <a href="../html/do.cgi?Content3+07Synchronization+4Lee-DriftSync&sync&1.1%201.0">sync 1.1 1.0</a> - In this ideal case, the drift is corrected for almost instantaneously.  In practice, however, it is difficult for the drift estimation to be as exact as in this (rather contrived) example.
</dd>
<dd>
  <a href="../html/do.cgi?Content3+07Synchronization+4Lee-DriftSync&sync&1.1%202.0">sync 1.1 2.0</a> - The drift is correct over time, resulting in minimal artifacts, even if the drift estimation is not 100% accurate.
