<h2><a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman" name="2Brozman">Polyrhythm and Musical Culture - Brozman</a></h2>

<dd>
In his article, Bob Brozman suggests a variety of rhythmic exercises for the reader to perform to get a feel for polyrhythm. 
While we have tried to describe these exercises in as clear language as possible they can be confusing especially for non-musicians. 
My colleague, Daniel Steinberg, generously donated a long evening to interpret and perform these excercises.

<p>
The following are MPEG1 encoded video clips of each exercise:

<ul>
<li> Example 1: <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex1.mpg"><b>1</b>,2,3,<b>1</b>,2,3 with 1's accented</a> (accent is external stimulus, and the 1,2,3 grouping the internal stimulus)

<li> Example 2: <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex2.mpg">Comparing external stimuli by accenting the 1 in <b>1</b>,2,<b>1</b>,2 or <b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4</a>

<li> Example 3: <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex3.mpg">Different ways to count 12 cycle: <b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4 vs <b>1</b>,2,3,<b>2</b>,2,3,<b>3</b>,2,3,<b>4</b>,2,3 vs 1 and-a, 2 and-a, 3 and-a, 4 and-a</a>

<li> Example 4: Tension can be created by <i>playing</i> the external stimuli by moving the accented beats. One musician might accent the 1's: <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex4.mpg">
<b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4</a>

<li> Example 5: Superimposing cycles of 12. 4 sets of three pulses and 3 sets of four pulses:
<a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex5.mpg">
<br>
<b>1</b>,2,3,<b>1</b>,2,3,<b>1</b>,2,3,<b>1</b>,2,3 on 
<br>
<b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4,<b>1</b>,2,3,4</a>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Example 6: First use of <i>and</i> is to divide every beat in 1/2 <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex6.mpg">1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and</a>

<li> Example 7: Second use of <i>and</i> divides beat into three parts (triplets) by saying the <b>AND</b> as <b>and a</b><a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex7.mpg">
1 and a 2 and a 3 and a 4 and a</a>

<li> Example 8: Third use of <i>and</i>, the blues shuffle, also divides beat into triplets, the <i>2</i> of each triplet (the <i>and</i> of each <i>and a</i>) is silent leaving: <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex8.mpg">
1 - a 2 - a 3 - a 4 - a</a>

<li> Example 9: 
A final rare use of <i>and</i> and may sound unusual to the uninitiated listener. The <b>3</b> of each triplet is silent, the beat is divided into thirds, and has a forcefully sounded <b>AND</b>
<a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex9.mpg"> 1 and - 2 and - 3 and - 4 and -</a>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Example 10: First triplet exercise <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex10.mpg">
triplets with alternating hands </a>

<li> Example 11: Second triplet exercise <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex11.mpg">
tiplets alternating beats between leg and chest</a>

<li> Example 12: Strengthen internal resolve by <i>playing</i> one of the beats silently <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex12.mpg">alternating triplets with silent beat</a>

<li> Example 13: Finaly further strengthen both internal count and external stimulus by
<a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex13.mpg">alternating triplet on hand and foot</a>
</ul>

<ul>
<li> Example 14: Basic Polyrhythm playing 2 against 3 with both hands <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex14.mpg">
<br> <b>1</b> 2 <b> 3 </b> 4 <b>5</b> 6 (right hand)<br><b>1</b> 2 3 <b>4</b> 5 6 (left hand)
</a>

<li> Example 15: Increasing differentiation and coordination by <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex15.mpg">walking in three clapping in two</a>

<li> Example 16: The <i>other way</i><a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex16.mpg">
walking in two clapping in three</a>

<li> Example 17: If you can perform 
<a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex17.mpg">
polyrhythm while holding a conversation</a> then you have integrated the skills 

<li> Example 18: More challenging polyrhythm <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex18.mpg">three against four on hands</a>

<li> Example 19: <a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex19.mpg">three against four on hands and chest</a>

<li> Example 20: <i>Expansion</i> of 3/4 waltz meter to 
<a href="../../Content3/08MusicComposition/2Brozman/ex20.mpg">
6/8 time</a>
opens the door to 2-against-3 syncopation possibilities
