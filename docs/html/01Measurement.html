<dd>
This demo illustrates an amplitude ramp. Specifically, this demo plays a series
of sounds at lower and lower amplitudes. The amplitude differences are smaller
than the just noticeable difference, and hence, appear to be a single continuous
sound of decreasing volume instead of the series of sounds they actually are.
Parameters were selected to minimize discontinuities by changing amplitude only
at zero crossings.

Run <a href="do.cgi?..+..+Content/01Measurement/1Greenebaum/amplitudeRamp&0.9">amplitudeRamp 0.9</a> to play this demo.
Run <a href="do.cgi?..+..+Content/01Measurement/1Greenebaum/amplitudeRamp&0.2">amplitudeRamp 0.2</a> for a more rapid ramp and noticably discrete sounds.

This illustration demonstrates that this smooth ramp is comprised of sounds of
discrete amplitudes:
