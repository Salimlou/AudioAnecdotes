The files in this directory comprise the major part of the utility
library used in the Speech Research Lab (SRL) of the duPont Hospital
for Children. With the exception of the functions in allocsp.c/h, all
code is the original work of SRL staff (primarily Bunnell). The
allocsp functions probably derive from code that was originally
provided by researchers at the Oregon Graduate Institute as part of a
Neural Network package called opt.  However, any copyright
notification or other header information from the original package has
been lost and I do not know if the code was original with programmers
at OGI or if it originated elsewhere.
